# Discount Calculator ðŸ›’ðŸ’¸

A simple Python program that calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount.  
It only applies the discount if the percentage is **20% or more**. Otherwise, it politely tells you no discount is applied.

## How It Works
1. The program asks the user for:
   - The **original price** of the item.
   - The **discount percentage**.
2. If the discount percentage is **20% or higher**, it calculates the discounted price and shows you how much you saved.
3. If the discount is less than 20%, it keeps the original price.

## Example Run
Enter the original price: 1000
Enter the discount percentage: 25

Discount applied! You saved 250.00.
The final price is: 750.00
